Since the early days of our chapter, [SigEp at UT Martin](https://utmartin.sigep.org/) has embraced technology as a way to improve the fraternity experience. We built one of the first known SigEp chapter websites in the country in the mid-1990s and pioneered data-driven tools to keep in touch with our alumni. Open source is a terrific way to share what we've built and allow others to collaborate with us.

All of our software is built with **Virtue**, **Diligence** and **Brotherly Love**.
